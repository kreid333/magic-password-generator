# Project Title

Generating a random password using Javascript

## Description

For this project, I had to create Javascript code that would generate a randomized password. It had to be as long as the user prompted for it to be, as well as include the characters (lowercase, uppercase, special, and/or numeric) that the user wanted.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To access this project, you would want to go in Git Bash (or any other terminal you use), pull all files within the "gt-atl-fsf-ft-08-2020-u-c" repo, go to the "02-Homework" folder within "03-Javascript", and copy the files within the "Develop" folder and the "README.md" (for referencing what you are suppose to be doing).

### Executing program

Open HTML file in a browser to view how it looks visually and to see how it operates. I would recommend using console.log() in your Javascript file to see what your code is doing.
